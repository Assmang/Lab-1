    <h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in a quaint mountain village in the year 1994, to parents who were illiterate <em>and</em> left-handed. Despite their shortcomings, they loved me deeply. However, they <strong>did not</strong> love me deeply enough to buy me a Mustang for my 16th birthday - probably because they were poor as dirt and could barely afford a mule between them.</p>
    <p>
      I will never forgive them for their indiscretion. Now that I am a multi-billionaire myself, I drive past their house in my pumpkin carriage at 3AM every 13 days, peppering their thatch walls with sunflower seeds and braying my donkey while they're trying to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>I have many ambitions, but for the sake of brevity I'll narrow the list down to just this one: I intend to sail beyond the edge of the world with my three-legged dog named Willie (I have included a picture of Willie below). Since my wife's boyfriend gave me his McDonald's employee discount card, I expect we'll eat like kings along the way.</p>
