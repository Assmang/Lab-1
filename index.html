    <h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in a quaint mountain village in the year 1994, to parents who were illiterate <em>and</em> left-handed.
      Despite their shortcomings, they loved me deeply. However, they <strong>did not</strong> love me deeply enough to
      buy me a Mustang for my 16th birthday - probably because they were poor as dirt and could barely afford a mule
      between them. <br>I have never forgiven
      them for their indiscretion. Now that I am a multi-billionaire myself, I make sure to drive past their house in my
      pumpkin carriage at 3AM every 13 days,
      peppering their thatch walls with sunflower seeds and braying my donkey while they're trying to sleep.
      <br>I have many ambitions, but for the sake of brevity I have narrowed the list down to just this one: I intend to
      sail beyond the edge of the world with my three-legged dog named Willie. Since my wife's boyfriend gave me his
      McDonald's employee discount card, I expect
      we'll eat like kings along the way.
